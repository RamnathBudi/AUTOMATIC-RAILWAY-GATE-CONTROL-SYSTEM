AUTOMATIC RAILWAY GATE

## üìå Project Overview

**ABSTRACT **

The main aim of this project is to operate and control the unmanned railway gate in the proper 
manner in order to avoid the accidents in the unmanned railway crossing. In a country like ours 
where there are many unmanned railway crossings, accidents are increasing day by day. These 
train accidents are due to the absence of human power in the railway. In order to overcome the 
accidents due to the above problem we have planned to design the project. Automatic Railway 
Gate Control System with High Speed Alerting System is an innovative circuit which 
automatically controls the operation of railway gates detecting the arrival and departure of 
trains at the gate. It has detectors at the far away distance on the railway track which allows us 
to know the arrival and departure of the train. These detectors are given to microcontroller 
which activates the motors which open/close the railway gate correspondingly. If the train is 
near by the railway gate then the microcontroller automatically activates the alarm and this 
alerts the passengers.This can be implemented in manned level crossings also, as manual errors 
can be eliminated by automation. 

## **INTRODUCTION**

Railways being safest and cheapest modes of transportation are preferred over all the other 
means of transport. So, it is essential to maintain and improve the current level of safety. A safe 
railway is more efficient and also a more attractive transport choice, enabling society to  
address the environmental and economic challenges of the 21st century. Railway safety is a 
crucial aspect of rail operation over the world. When we go through newspapers, we come 
across many railway accidents occurring at different railway level crossings and many people 
are dying. The place where rail track and highway/road intersects each other at the same level 
is known as ‚Äúlevel crossing‚Äù. Bangladesh Railway said at least 201 people were killed and 349 
others injured in 264 accidents at different level crossings in last seven years till 2013[1]. This 
is mainly due to the carelessness in manual operations or lack of workers at level crossing. 
There is an inherent unreliability in the present manual system. Automatic railway gate control 
system is an arrangement of physical components which sense the arrival of the train and make the gate pull up and pull down automatically. As a train approaches at the railway crossing 
from either side, the sensors placed at a certain distance from the gate detect the approaching 
train and accordingly controls the operation of the gate. To avoid the accidents, sensors placed 
at some distance from the gate detect the departure of the train. The signal about the departure 
is sent to the microcontroller, which in turn operates the motor and opens the gate. Thus, the 
time for which the gate is closed is less compared to the manually operated gates since the gate 
is closed depending upon the telephone call from the previous station. Also reliability is high, 
as it is not subjected to manual errors. For the railway, research on automatic gate controller 
systems has traditionally focused on two main areas:information transmission and gate 
controlling. Problems related to information transmission concern train detection and fast 
transmission of this information to the control unit. Problems those are related to the gate 
controlling very sophisticated and challenging. They comprise presence of train, immediate <img width="1378" height="838" alt="image2-19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c3f3b5b-b33e-488e-86ec-d628e53e0ce0" />

closing and opening of gates. The existing solutions have many complexities and require 
research for supporting railway
